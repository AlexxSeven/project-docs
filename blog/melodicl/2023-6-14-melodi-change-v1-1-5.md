- (‚≠ê) Fixed bad math and parameter flow for emissive alt color. (Fixes Alt color not working if audiolink wasn't installed)

## Minor Changes:

- Set the `Custom Colors` toggle to not hide if main color is being overridden.
- Fixed missing help boxes that explained the color options under `Fresnel Parameters > Color Options.`
