It\'s advised to use a copy/backup material instead to ensure you can rollback if needed.\\n\\n:::\\n- Fixed issues with audio link parameters using incorrect math in certain functions.\\n- Fixed Cutout alpha mode not properly using trail mask.\\n- Changed the property name for `Cutoff` to fix an issue where it would default to 0.5 instead of 0. (Fixes alpha opaque bug.)\\n- Fixed Audiolink chronotensity being represented as a rotation rather than time in all instances as they were always time based.\\n(fixes AL time jitter on all texture scrolls, gradient scrolls, and object rotation effects)\\n- Removed `Rotation Speed` from all AL Chronotensity based options.\\n- Increased `Effect Speed` maximum on all chronotensity based options from 1 to 3.\\n- Fixed all time based parameters to utilize time properly and fixed consistency issues in large unity time values.\\n- Completely reworked `Randomize axis` under `AudioLink > Object Rotation` to utilize AL chrono properly now.\\n- `Randomize axis` under `AudioLink > Object Rotation` is no longer multiplicative of object rotation axis.\\n- Removed `Effect Type` from `AudioLink > Object Rotation` as it conflicted with randomize axis.\\n- Reworked the math and parameters completely for `Object Rotation` to support future growth.\\n- Reduced the number of samplers across the shader through the utilization of sampler states.\\n- Made rotation mode a toggle-able feature. tied the AudioLink menu for it to its enabled-state.\\n- Added a gamma correction toggle to all color palette selectors.\\n- (\u2b50) Fixed tangent calculation in physically lit mode for object rotations (fixes funky normals.)\\n- (\u2b50) Adjusted the math around specular to fix high parameter numbers causing the effect to spill past a set specular map and other specularity visual issues.\\n- (\u2b50) Completely reworked the lit mode custom lighting model to fix lighting calculation.\\n- (\u2b50) Fixed issues with vertex lighting (point/spot lights) and vertex/object animation.\\n- (\u2b50) Added a toggle for vertex lighting support under `Shader Options` when lit mode is set to `Physical`.\\n- (\u2b50) Added shading color settings to the simulated lighting menu.\\n- (\u2b50) Changed manual light position to a float3 from a set of 3 ranged (-1, 1) floats.\\n- (\u2b50) Added a position type enum to manual light direction mode to swap from local and world pos.\\n\\n## Minor Changes:\\n- Reworked and trimmed sevreal unused functions and lines of code from the shader.\\n- Renamed audio link menus from `Audio Link Settings` to `\u266b\u266a AudioLink Settings \u266a\u266b`\\n- Rearranged and reorganized the AudioLink menu inside Trail Mask.\\n- Renamed `Diffuse Texture` to `Albedo Texture` to better represent how the texture was used mathmatically.\\n- Adjusted all references to `Diffuse Texture` to align with the name change to `Albedo Texture.`\\n- Moved the Albedo/Diffuse Distortion menu into the `Albedo Texture Settings` menu as it\'s technically a setting for it.\\n- Renamed all instances of `Rotation Mode` to `Motion Mode` where the effect was motion/panning rather than rotation.\\n- Fixed a bug where `_Color` was set as a property multiple times in the shader.\\n- Reworked the look of the `AudioLink > Object Rotation` menu.\\n- Reworked the look of a few UI elements due to changes in recent thry editor versions.\\n- (\u2b50) Renamed the `Blend Env Lights` option to `Blend Directional Lights` to clarify what it does.\\n\\n## Additions:\\n- Added `Affect Cutoff` toggles under the rollouts for Diffuse Texture and Trail Mask.\\n- Added `Object Distortion` option for even more neat effects!\\n- Support for BloomFogEnvironment added, options can be found under the `BeatSaber Options` Menu! (uses code from [/github/kaitlyndotmoe](https://github.com/kaitlyndotmoe/BeatSaberShaderTools)).\\n- Added Thry version checks and warnings for extremely outdated and/or missing installs.\\n- Added Axis settings to the `AudioLink > Object Rotation` menu.\\n- Added `Light ID #` options to `BeatSaber Settings > Custom Colors Override` to pull from the global light IDs like platform light objects.\\n- (\u2b50) Added a `Scene Light Illumination` under the `custom` mode of light color options.\\n- (\u2b50) Added `Scene Light Direction` under the light direction option.\\n- (\u2b50) Added warning for Scene lighting and Scene Light Dir options to clarify they require a mod that creates scene lights.\\n- (\u2b50) Added `Reflections` rollout and options to `Specular Settings`.\\n- (\u2b50) Added Support for cube maps and reflection probes. under `Specular Texture Settings > Reflection Settings.`\\n- (\u2b50) Added Ambient Occlusion map support to `Physical` light mode.\\n- (\u2b50) Added Normal map support to `Physical` light mode (it\'s now in its own rollout menu.)\\n\\n## Extra:\\n- Updated the packaged thry editor version to `2.45.1` as the shader now utilizes features from it.\\n\\n## (\u2b50) Preview:\\n\\n<div className=\'player-wrapper\'>\\n    <ReactPlayer\\n        className=\'react-player\'\\n        playing\\n        loop\\n        playsinline\\n        controls\\n        volume=\'1\'\\n        muted\\n        url=\'https://share.alexxseven.com/d0bd9fccab5b.mp4\'\\n        height=\'100%\'\\n        width=\'100%\'\\n    />\\n</div>"},{"id":"unlitst-change-latest","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/unlitst-change-latest","source":"@site/blog/unlitstcl/2023-10-3-unlitst-change-v1-1.md","title":"BS Unlit Standard Changelog (v1.1)","description":"Minor Changes:","date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 3, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Shaders","permalink":"/blog/tags/shaders"},{"label":"UnlitStandard","permalink":"/blog/tags/unlit-standard"},{"label":"Changelogs","permalink":"/blog/tags/changelogs"}],"readingTime":0.21,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"AlexxSeven","title":"Local Potato","url":"https://alexxseven.com/","imageURL":"https://github.com/AlexxSeven.png","key":"alexxseven"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"unlitst-change-latest","title":"BS Unlit Standard Changelog (v1.1)","authors":"alexxseven","tags":["Shaders","UnlitStandard","Changelogs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Melodi Unlit & Premium Changelog (v1.2.0)","permalink":"/blog/melodi-change-latest"},"nextItem":{"title":"Glass Refraction Changelog (v1.1)","permalink":"/blog/glassref-change-latest"}},"content":"## Minor Changes:\\n- Fixed material drawer in latest thry editor.\\n\\n## Additions:\\n- Added version lower/unsupported/missing warnings for invalid thry editor installs.\\n\\n## Extra:\\n- Updated the packaged thry editor version to 2.45.1 as the shader now utilizes features from it."},{"id":"glassref-change-latest","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/glassref-change-latest","source":"@site/blog/glassrefcl/2023-8-04-glassref-change-v1-1.md","title":"Glass Refraction Changelog (v1.1)","description":"Glass refraction is a premium only shader.","date":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Shaders","permalink":"/blog/tags/shaders"},{"label":"Glass Refraction","permalink":"/blog/tags/glass-refraction"},{"label":"Changelogs","permalink":"/blog/tags/changelogs"}],"readingTime":0.42,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"AlexxSeven","title":"Local Potato","url":"https://alexxseven.com/","imageURL":"https://github.com/AlexxSeven.png","key":"alexxseven"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"glassref-change-latest","title":"Glass Refraction Changelog (v1.1)","authors":"alexxseven","tags":["Shaders","Glass Refraction","Changelogs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"BS Unlit Standard Changelog (v1.1)","permalink":"/blog/unlitst-change-latest"},"nextItem":{"title":"Melodi Unlit & Premium Changelog (v1.1.6)","permalink":"/blog/melodi-change-v1-1-6"}},"content":":::note \\n\\nGlass refraction is a premium only shader.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Major Changes:\\n:::caution\\n\\nThe changes in this section will affect the look of materials using previous versions!
