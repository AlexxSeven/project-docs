(Fixes alpha opaque bug.)\\n- Fixed Audiolink chronotensity being represented as a rotation rather than time in all instances as they were always time based.\\n(fixes AL time jitter on all texture scrolls, gradient scrolls, and object rotation effects)\\n- Removed `Rotation Speed` from all AL Chronotensity based options.\\n- Increased `Effect Speed` maximum on all chronotensity based options from 1 to 3.\\n- Fixed all time based parameters to utilize time properly and fixed consistency issues in large unity time values.\\n- Completely reworked `Randomize axis` under `AudioLink > Object Rotation` to utilize AL chrono properly now.\\n- `Randomize axis` under `AudioLink > Object Rotation` is no longer multiplicative of object rotation axis.\\n- Removed `Effect Type` from `AudioLink > Object Rotation` as it conflicted with randomize axis.\\n- Reworked the math and parameters completely for `Object Rotation` to support future growth.\\n- Reduced the number of samplers across the shader through the utilization of sampler states.\\n- Made rotation mode a toggle-able feature. tied the AudioLink menu for it to its enabled-state.\\n- Added a gamma correction toggle to all color palette selectors.\\n- (\u2b50) Fixed tangent calculation in physically lit mode for object rotations (fixes funky normals.)\\n- (\u2b50) Adjusted the math around specular to fix high parameter numbers causing the effect to spill past a set specular map and other specularity visual issues.\\n- (\u2b50) Completely reworked the lit mode custom lighting model to fix lighting calculation.\\n- (\u2b50) Fixed issues with vertex lighting (point/spot lights) and vertex/object animation.\\n- (\u2b50) Added a toggle for vertex lighting support under `Shader Options` when lit mode is set to `Physical`.\\n- (\u2b50) Added shading color settings to the simulated lighting menu.\\n- (\u2b50) Changed manual light position to a float3 from a set of 3 ranged (-1, 1) floats.\\n- (\u2b50) Added a position type enum to manual light direction mode to swap from local and world pos.\\n\\n## Minor Changes:\\n- Reworked and trimmed sevreal unused functions and lines of code from the shader.\\n- Renamed audio link menus from `Audio Link Settings` to `\u266b\u266a AudioLink Settings \u266a\u266b`\\n- Rearranged and reorganized the AudioLink menu inside Trail Mask.\\n- Renamed `Diffuse Texture` to `Albedo Texture` to better represent how the texture was used mathmatically.\\n- Adjusted all references to `Diffuse Texture` to align with the name change to `Albedo Texture.`\\n- Moved the Albedo/Diffuse Distortion menu into the `Albedo Texture Settings` menu as it\'s technically a setting for it.\\n- Renamed all instances of `Rotation Mode` to `Motion Mode` where the effect was motion/panning rather than rotation.\\n- Fixed a bug where `_Color` was set as a property multiple times in the shader.\\n- Reworked the look of the `AudioLink > Object Rotation` menu.\\n- Reworked the look of a few UI elements due to changes in recent thry editor versions.\\n- (\u2b50) Renamed the `Blend Env Lights` option to `Blend Directional Lights` to clarify what it does.\\n\\n## Additions:\\n- Added `Affect Cutoff` toggles under the rollouts for Diffuse Texture and Trail Mask.\\n- Added `Object Distortion` option for even more neat effects!\\n- Support for BloomFogEnvironment added, options can be found under the `BeatSaber Options` Menu!
